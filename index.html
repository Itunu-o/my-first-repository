<h2>About Me</h2>

<div>Hello there! I'm Itunu, a budding web developer with a never-ending curiosity for technology. 
    With a master's in science communication, I'm interested in bridging the gap of understanding 
    to enhance knowledge and usage of technological tools by non-specialists. 
    Upon completing the web development program, I intend to assist strictly physical establishments
    in transitioning into the online market by developing a digital presence that'll garner more audience and revenue.</div>
